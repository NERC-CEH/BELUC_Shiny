<h1>About this Shiny App</h1>
<p>This Shiny app provides a way of exploring and evaluating the Bayesian approach to estimating land use change (BELUC), as published by Levy, <em>et al.</em> (2018). The main purpose is to list assumptions and parameter settings, and show model output summaries based on the choices of parameter and dataset.</p>
<p>The outputs here have been pre-computed, hence the results are restricted to adjusting one variable at a time.</p>
